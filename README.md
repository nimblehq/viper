# VIPER

VIPER is an application of **Clean Architecture** to iOS apps.

The word VIPER is a backronym for `View`, `Interactor`, `Presenter`, `Entity`, and `Router`.

The VIPER provides:
- **Isolation**. Individual VIPER classes have distinct responsibilities like routing, business, view logic.
- **Testability**. Classes must be easy to unit test.
- **Scalability**. VIPER is an architecture pattern that supports scaling to developers working on the same codebase and dozen VIPER modules.
- **Tooling**. XCode templates improve developer productivity for teams.
