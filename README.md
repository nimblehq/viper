# VIPER Architecture

VIPER is an application of **Clean Architecture** to iOS apps. 

The word VIPER is a backronym for `View`, `Interactor`, `Presenter`, `Entity`, and `Router`

The VIPER provides:
- **Isolation**. Individual VIPER classes have distinct responsibilities like: routing, business, view logic.
- **Testability**. Classes must be easy to unit test.
- **Scalability**. VIPER is an architecture pattern that supports to scale to developers working on the same codebase and dozen VIPER modules.
- **Tooling**. XCode templates improve developer productivity for teams.

## Documentation

To get started with VIPER, please refer to the [VIPER documentation](https://github.com/nimblehq/viper/wiki)*[WIP]* . This describes VIPER, from its main parts and how we work with VIPER.

To get more hands on with VIPER, we have written a [series of tutorials](https://github.com/nimblehq/viper/wiki)*[WIP]* that run you through the main aspects of VIPER with hands-on examples.
